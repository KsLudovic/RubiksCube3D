to run it, you'll have to download Processing : https://processing.org/download/


work in progress : need to import intuitive controls for android version

play with f, F, b, B, u, U, d, D, l, L, r, R

shuffle is set to 25 movements, you can make it random (i suggest you to change the framerate, so it does it quicker, this project was done this way to see smooth animation)
